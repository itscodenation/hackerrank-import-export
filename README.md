This App already works! But, we want to separate the different components into separate files.

1) Start in App.js.
2) Move the Counter component to the file named for it.
3) Make the Counter the component the default export from the file.
4) Import the Counter component in this file
5) Remove or comment out the Counter component function below.
6) Repeat steps 2-5 for the Button component.
7) Run tests.
